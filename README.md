# A dashboard made with Quarto

A custom dashboard using R and Quarto. In this project, I wanted to group related data visualizations in a single place based on specific needs instead of having a generic dashboard for everything. The dashboard shows how compensation levels vary based on the employee's role, department, experience level, and demographics.
